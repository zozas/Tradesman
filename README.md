Tradesman is a turn-based online strategy game on producing, manufacturing and trading.

Developed in HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL.

A playable version of the game has been installed in a free hosting service :

Notive that due to restrictions of the free hosting plan, SMPT service is unavailable. As so, password remind service is not available.

To host the game on a server, create a database (based on the tradesman.sql file) and edit the configuration file (config.ini.php) accordingly.

Currently supporting only the english language.
